## `./parallel`
Contains three attempts in implementing parallel quicksort using Java Multithreading, MPI, and OpenMP. Specific instructions for compiling and running the codes are avaible as comments in the code file(s).

**Side note:** When running `parallel/OpenMP/parallel-quicksort.c` using the performance evaluation option, the same random array of size *n* is copied for every test on *np* to achieve impartial results.

## `./serial`
Contains Java and C implementations of the traditional serial QuickSort algorithm.
